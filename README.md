# Open Serial Section Site


## Conventions and tips
* `_pages` holds the main pages
* `_posts` holds blog. Date of blog entry derived from file name. 
* Images on home page and main pages should have ratio 1:1.61
* Blog teaser images appear as small icons along the bottom of other posts. They should be 4:1 aspect ratio.
* Banners should be about 2000 x 400 px
* [Info on adding multiple author details for blog posting](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/authors/)
* The layout class used for the home page can only display three images. So it creates a gap if you add only two. 
* To add images to blog posts [see dichroic post as an example](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/OpenSerialSection/edit/master/_posts/2016-11-16-Changing_TissueCyte_Dichroics.md)

## Contributing

Having trouble working with the theme? Found a typo in the documentation? Interested in adding a feature or [fixing a bug](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues)? Then by all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/new) or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.

Minimal Mistakes has been designed as a base for you to customize and fit your site's unique needs. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. If it's not something that most people will use, I probably won't consider it. When in doubt ask. 

This goes for author sidebar links and "share button" additions -- I have no intention of merging in every possibly option, the essentials are there to get you started :smile:.
